# The world he is in
Runeterra is the rather large continet inhabiting many different societies and species. From dragons, forest creatures, humans to celestial. It's a place riddeled with the influence of magic. 
Some time ago, magic ravaged the world and left most of the inhabitantis in fear of it. Some societies ingore it, some fear it, some embarce it. 
The city of Piltover is one that avoids it entierly, it was built with the sole purpouse of advancing technology and avoiding the need of magic. It's the city of invoation. But the city is devided in two, Topside and The Undercity. Topside is what you'd imagine a city of inovation would look like. It had houses, blimps, no planes though. They had scientis and a police force. The undercity on the other hand was a place that was more industrial and unsafe. It was shrouded in crime. The city is 
# Viktors origin
Viktor comes from the Undercity. Born with a malformed leg and needing a cane to walk, he was depicted as someone who was isolated from others. It was never specifically said he was isolated due to being cast out. Even as a child he seemed as someone who was more inclined to being alone and immersing himself in working on his inventions.

How Heimerdinger discovers Viktor is unclear. Still, somewhere in his late teens, Heimerdinger encounters him and takes him under his wing, allowing him to study at the University of Piltover. Viktor goes on to become his assistant as Dean of the Academy.

# Scene Analysis
## Jayce police questioning
S1E2 04:50-05:50
The scene takes place **in Jayce’s workshop, which is now in complete disarray after a break-in.** A **large hole in the wall**—the result of an explosion—exposes the damage that has been done. Enforcers move through the space, **handling Jayce’s belongings,** examining the various tools and research materials scattered across the room.  

**Grayson, the head enforcer, questions Jayce.**  

**"Let's go over it again."**  

Jayce, defensive but desperate, insists, **"You have to believe me. I didn't do this."**  

Grayson remains calm but firm. **"Relax, kid. We know it was a break-in, but that doesn't explain this."** She gestures toward the scene, **where restricted equipment and volatile materials are strewn about.**  

As she continues inspecting, she states, **"There's a lot of restricted items here, and I don't see any permits."** Her tone makes it clear—**Jayce is in serious trouble.**  

**"You wanna tell me how you got them?"** she presses.  

Jayce watches as **enforcers handle his equipment, moving things without care.** His frustration rises as he **sees them touching his work.**  

**"Hey, hey! Be careful with that, please."** His concern isn’t for any danger—it’s for **his belongings, his research, the things that matter to him.**  

Grayson, unimpressed, replies dryly, **"I believe someone should have said that earlier."**  

She turns back to Jayce, her voice carrying a mix of curiosity and suspicion. **"What happened here?"**  

Jayce, at a loss for words, simply shrugs. **"Science, I guess?"**  

Grayson narrows her eyes. **"Last time I checked, science didn't require illegal equipment."**  

At this moment, **another voice enters the conversation.**  

**"Nor was this approved by the Academy."**  

The camera shifts to reveal **Viktor, standing calmly amidst the wreckage.** His presence is quiet but authoritative—**he is not an enforcer, but he is here with purpose.**  

His tone is **matter-of-fact, not personal.** **"Who authorized your research?"**  

Jayce, still trying to process what is happening, responds, **"It was an independent study. Who are you anyway?"**  

Viktor remains composed as he introduces himself. **"I'm assistant to the Dean of the Academy, who it may serve you to remember is also head of the Council."** His words **carry weight, reminding Jayce just how much trouble he is in.**  

Viktor continues, **"He sent me here to ensure that anything dangerous is removed safely."** His **calm and observant nature** makes it clear—**this is not a personal judgment; it is his job.**  

Then, in a slightly dry but pointed remark, he **glances at his list before looking directly at Jayce.**  

**"Which, according to my list, includes you."**  

Jayce, caught off guard, reacts immediately. **"What? How am I dangerous?"**  

Viktor, **still impassive,** simply responds, **"Uh, that's for the Council to decide."**  

The scene ends with **Jayce realizing that his fate is no longer in his own hands, while Viktor, without hostility, has ensured that he will be brought before the Academy.**

## Jayce Council
S1E2 14:20-19:00
Jayce’s hearing was held in the **Council chamber**, with Viktor present among the crowd. Initially, **he showed no particular interest in the proceedings,** watching the interrogation with detachment. The Council questioned Jayce about his illegal experimentation, and while **he apologized and took responsibility for his recklessness,** the Council remained skeptical.  

The discussion revolved around the **danger of his work, the destruction it caused, and whether his research had any value.** It seemed like the hearing would end with Jayce’s quiet dismissal—until he suddenly **claimed he was trying to create magic.**  

The reaction was immediate—**gasps, outrage, disbelief.** Magic was feared, seen as a curse, something that could not be fabricated. **Viktor, however, reacted differently.** For the first time, his expression **shifted—his interest piqued.** He listened as Jayce defended his belief that magic could be mastered, that science could control what was once thought uncontrollable.  

But **Heimerdinger quickly shut him down.** He spoke of the dangers, the civilizations lost to the Arcane, warning that it could not be allowed in Piltover. The discussion turned from science to **fear, and the verdict became clear.** The Council moved to **banish Jayce from the city.**  

It was only through **his mother’s emotional plea** that they reconsidered. Instead, **he was expelled from the Academy and ordered never to return.**  

Viktor sat silently as the hearing ended. **While the Council dismissed Jayce as reckless, Viktor saw something else—an idea that had been cast aside, but one that might hold more truth than anyone was willing to admit.**

## Conversation with Heimerdinger
S1E2 20:51-
The scene takes place **in Heimerdinger’s lab**, where he and Viktor are **sorting through Jayce’s confiscated research.** Heimerdinger, still disappointed by the hearing, sighs, **"Oh. That foolish boy."**  

Viktor, flipping through Jayce’s notes, **casually admits his intrigue.** **"Yeah, I must admit, his theory intrigues."** His tone is neutral, but **his curiosity is evident.**  

Heimerdinger, ever the cautious scholar, responds, **"If dangerous ideas didn't excite the imagination, we would never wander astray."** He acknowledges the appeal of such concepts, but **implies that they often lead to disaster.**  

Still, Viktor’s curiosity lingers. **"Could it work? Could these stones really invoke magic?"** The question is genuine—despite his dismissal of Jayce’s recklessness, **he is now considering the idea itself.**  

But then, almost as if correcting himself, he immediately rejects the notion. **"Nonsense. It's far too unstable."**  

Heimerdinger, ever the mentor, challenges him. **"Could you stabilize it?"**  

Viktor hesitates. **"Me? Why would I? That only leads to more problems, and that poor boy has enough of them already."** His words suggest **he is not eager to follow in Jayce’s footsteps,** but the fact that Heimerdinger even asked implies that the idea is **not entirely impossible.**  

Heimerdinger then turns to **the task at hand.** **"There. Come tomorrow morning, his research will be safely disposed of."** His tone makes it clear—**there will be no further discussion of this.**  

As he leaves, he reinforces his stance. **"No, no, no. Magic is far too dangerous in the wrong hands."**  

Viktor, however, does not move immediately. **Instead, he lingers, still holding Jayce’s research.** Without saying a word, **he takes the notes with him.** The decision is quiet, but significant—**he may not fully believe in Jayce’s ideas yet, but he is not willing to let them be erased.**

## Stopping Jayce
S1E2 31:43
This scene marks the beginning of Viktor and Jayce’s partnership, revealing Viktor’s personality and motivations. He does not approach Jayce with concern for his well-being, nor does he attempt to comfort him. Instead, he treats the situation with a level of detachment, his dry wit and sarcasm making it clear that he isn’t here out of personal sympathy. His opening line—**"Am I interrupting?"**—immediately sets the tone, showing that his focus isn’t on Jayce’s emotional state but on something entirely different: Jayce’s work.

Viktor’s actions in this moment are not driven by an intent to help or harm Jayce; rather, they revolve around his own interests. He sees potential in Hextech and recognizes that Jayce might have the knowledge to bring it to life. His motivation isn’t about rescuing Jayce from despair, but about pursuing scientific progress. His statement—**"When you’re going to change the world, don’t ask for permission."**—reflects his core philosophy: innovation should not be hindered by societal approval or personal setbacks.

While their relationship at this stage is not one of friendship, it is also not one of manipulation. Viktor does not exploit Jayce’s vulnerability, nor does he attempt to emotionally connect with him. His approach is straightforward: he sees value in Jayce’s work, and he wants to be part of it. This makes their partnership transactional in nature, but not in a cold or exploitative way—rather, it is built on mutual ambition. Over time, this foundation may evolve, but in this moment, Viktor’s actions are entirely self-driven, neither inherently kind nor cruel, but simply pragmatic.

## Researching in Jayce's room
S1E3 07:30
Jayce and Viktor work together on solving the problem of stabilizing Hextech. Jayce initially believes he needs to dampen the oscillations, but Viktor corrects him, explaining that the crystals will only stabilize at high frequency. Jayce quickly understands and realizes they need to **crank it** to make it work. When Viktor repeats the phrase, there’s a noticeable awkwardness to it—like someone who is serious and not used to using slang, almost as if he's trying it out for the first time.

Although the solution seems correct on paper, they lack the necessary equipment to test it. Jayce suggests using his lab, but Viktor informs him that all of his research is scheduled to be destroyed the next day. Shocked, Jayce considers presenting their equations to the Council in hopes of proving their idea, but Viktor dismisses the idea, insisting that they need proof, not just promises. Throughout this discussion, Viktor remains level-headed, focusing solely on what needs to be done rather than reacting emotionally to the situation.

When Jayce points out that the enforcers have confiscated all of the crystals, leaving them without a way to test their theory, Viktor quickly realizes that they are locked away in Heimerdinger’s lab. His face shifts as he has a sudden moment of realization—his eyes widen slightly, and he reaches for his pocket almost instinctively, as if his body reacts before he fully processes the thought. The speed with which he pulls out the keys and the ease of his decision show that the second he identified a path forward, he was ready to take it without hesitation. It’s a rare moment of impulsivity for him, revealing that once he sees a solution, he is willing to act immediately, regardless of the risks. While this reaction may seem out of character compared to his usual composed nature, it suggests that when it comes to scientific progress, he values results over caution.

When Jayce hesitates at the danger of their actions, Viktor simply tells him, **"Better be right then."** Jayce then questions why Viktor would take such a risk, and Viktor explains that he never intended to remain an assistant—his goal as a scientist is to make discoveries that improve the world. At this moment, he acknowledges Hextech as Jayce’s dream, reinforcing the idea that, at this stage, he sees himself as someone pushing another’s vision forward rather than leading it himself. However, the fact that he is willing to take such a risk for it shows that his investment in the project goes beyond just assisting—it is something he truly believes in. When Jayce finally acknowledges their shared ambition by calling it **"Our Hextech dream,"** it marks a shift in their dynamic, subtly elevating Viktor’s role from assistant to partner in bringing Hextech to life.

## Breaking into the Lab
E3 13:10
Viktor and Jayce attempt to break into Heimerdinger’s lab, with Viktor fumbling with the keys to unlock the door. Before they can get inside, Councilor Mel Medarda catches them in the act. She acknowledges the risk they are taking, noting their conviction. Jayce tries to recover from the situation, while Viktor, in an attempt at humor, sarcastically remarks, **"Wait a minute, this isn't my bedroom. How could I have…?"** Despite the joke, he stays mostly in the background during this exchange.

Mel questions how they expect to prove their theory when they failed to do so earlier, to which Viktor confidently states that they have figured out how to stabilize Hextech. However, Mel is skeptical, pointing out that even if they succeed, the Council would likely destroy their work. Viktor argues that Heimerdinger will recognize its potential, but Mel dismisses this, saying that the professor already understands what Hextech could become—and that it frightens him.

Jayce takes the lead in trying to convince her, passionately arguing that this technology is real and will inevitably change the world. He urges her to let them be the ones to lead its development. After considering his words, Mel ultimately decides to give them a chance, offering them one night to impress her before they risk losing everything.


## In the lab Part 1
E3 17:09
Jayce and Viktor begin their experiment, setting up their Hextech device in Heimerdinger’s lab. As the energy crackles around them, Jayce, looking over their notes, confirms that everything is in place.

Viktor, with an uncharacteristically animated and almost whimsical expression, excitedly says, **"It's time to crank it."** His exaggerated facial expression adds a slightly goofy element to the moment, showing a rare side of him that isn’t strictly serious. While this isn’t a defining trait of his character, it stands out as a brief, unexpected shift in his usual demeanor, so it's worth noting.

Jayce, unsure, asks if Viktor really knows what he's doing. In response, Viktor makes another animated expression—this time indicating that he's not entirely sure himself, but he's going for it anyway.

As they activate the device, the energy rapidly builds up, and Jayce panics, fearing that it won't hold. He points out the dangerous buildup, but Viktor remains firm, assuring him that the resonance will stabilize it and urging him to trust the process.

Meanwhile, outside, an enforcer notices the growing energy and begins to take interest in what’s happening.

## In the lab Part 2
E3 19:13
The experiment reaches a critical moment as the Hextech device activates, suspending the hex crystal in midair. Viktor, confident as ever, states, **"I told you it would work."** Jayce, still in awe, acknowledges the success and prepares to push the experiment further.

As he turns the dial on the machine, the hex crystal begins spinning faster. Initially, the increase in speed is steady, but at a certain point it rapidly accelerates. The danger is immediately obvious, and Viktor shouts, **"Disengage!"**—though by this point, the situation is already escalating beyond their control, making his warning more of a formality than an actual precaution.

The spinning reaches a critical point, and Jayce struggles to reach the dial in time. Before he can react, the machine releases a sudden burst of energy, causing a small explosion. Shards of shattered glass, instead of simply falling, are pulled back toward the blast’s origin, cutting Jayce on the cheek.

Finally, Jayce manages to stop the machine, bringing the experiment under control. Rather than expressing concern over the near disaster, Viktor, still fixated on the results, reacts with a single word: **"Incredible."** His excitement highlights his deep fascination with the experiment, prioritizing discovery over personal risk. While this moment reinforces his unwavering focus on progress, it’s not necessarily a defining trait—just another glimpse into how he perceives scientific breakthroughs.

## In the lab Part 3
E3 25:20
As Jayce and Viktor continue their experiment, Heimerdinger and a group of enforcers arrive outside the lab, demanding entry. The enforcers pound on the door, with Heimerdinger urging them to stop what he sees as reckless behavior. Inside, Viktor, in a more unsure tone than usual, quips, **"They're almost through. No pressure."** Jayce, far from reassured, retorts that it definitely sounds like pressure.  

Despite the mounting urgency, they push forward. As Jayce adjusts the dials, the hex crystal reacts in an unprecedented way—runic symbols begin appearing around it, floating in a circular pattern. Then, in a decisive moment, Jayce manipulates the controls, causing an explosion—not of destruction, but of controlled energy. At this moment, they successfully create **Hextech** just as the enforcers finally break through the door.  

The aftermath is breathtaking. Jayce and Viktor find themselves floating in midair, suspended on opposite sides of the hex stone, which is now surrounded by an energy field. Both of them wear expressions of pure joy as they realize what they’ve accomplished. Jayce playfully pushes a floating gear into the energy field, watching as it seamlessly teleports to Viktor on the other side.  

Heimerdinger, at first overwhelmed, finally speaks: **"You've actually done it."** But even as he acknowledges their success, he mutters to himself, **"Just because it can be done, doesn't mean…,"** signaling his concerns about the implications of their discovery.  

His serious tone is quickly undercut by a moment of unintended levity when he asks them to stop hovering. Viktor, caught up in the moment, replies, **"I'm not sure how to do that, sir."** The way he delivers the line comes off as unintentionally funny.

Then, somewhat unexpectedly, Mel walks in and takes control of the conversation, asserting that the Council will decide what comes next. She hints at a major shift in Piltover’s future, calling it **"the era of magic,"** though Jayce quickly corrects her, renaming it **"Hextech."**

## Seven years later
Over the course of seven years, Piltover experienced rapid industrial and economic growth, largely driven by the successful implementation of **Hextech**. The most significant advancement was the creation of the **Hexgates**, a system that allowed airships to travel efficiently between major trade routes. By stabilizing Hextech crystals, Jayce and Viktor enabled **fast, controlled teleportation of cargo**, making Piltover the center of global trade. This innovation dramatically increased the city’s prosperity and cemented Hextech as a defining force in Piltover’s progress.

During this time, Jayce became a public figure, widely celebrated for his role in Hextech’s success. He gained influence within the **Council**, though he was not yet a formal member. Meanwhile, Viktor, though equally responsible for Hextech’s foundation, remained outside the public eye, focusing entirely on further **scientific advancements**. His interest in **Hextech’s potential for medical applications** grew stronger, especially as his own health continued to deteriorate.

Beyond the Academy, Piltover’s relationship with the **Undercity** became more strained. Crime escalated, and reports of **Shimmer**, a powerful and highly addictive drug, became more frequent. While Viktor may have been aware of these issues through official reports or discussions at the Academy, his focus remained on pushing Hextech beyond its current limitations, seeing it as a means to overcome **human frailty**—a goal that would soon define his arc in Act 2.

## Showing the Hextech Gemstone
E4 11:09
Jayce and Viktor prepare to present their latest Hextech advancements, with Viktor expressing uncertainty about whether Heimerdinger will approve. Jayce, confident, reassures him that Heimerdinger shares their belief in using science to improve lives—they just need to prove that their innovations are safe. When Viktor brings up the Council, Jayce asserts that they have done everything asked of them, stabilizing the crystal and building the Hexgates, and now it’s their turn to shape the future of Hextech.  

When Heimerdinger arrives, Jayce warmly welcomes him, eager to begin the presentation. He starts by introducing the Hextech Gemstone, explaining that while magic was once too volatile for everyday use, they have now made it stable and accessible. Heimerdinger, upon seeing the gemstone, reacts with immediate shock and concern, stammering before exclaiming, **"Holy sprockets."**  

Viktor steps in to reassure him, explaining that they have fortified the crystals and made them completely stable. He formally presents this as **"the next chapter of Hextech,"** emphasizing that their innovation is safe and ready for practical use. Jayce follows up by demonstrating the potential applications of the gemstone, introducing **the Atlas Gauntlets**, designed to help miners work faster and without fatigue. Viktor then introduces **the Hex Claw**, a mechanical arm equipped with a powerful ray of light, explaining how artificers could use such a tool to create new advancements. His vision for Hextech is clear—he sees it as a means to build a better world, and now, for the first time, it is truly within reach.  

Jayce ends the demonstration confidently, but Heimerdinger remains cautious. He acknowledges their achievements and praises their ingenuity, but quickly tempers their expectations, stating that such breakthroughs require **"a decade of careful research"** before they will be ready for widespread use. Jayce, taken aback, questions the timeline, but Heimerdinger assures him that time passes quickly.  

Viktor, however, pushes back, arguing that **Hextech can start improving lives now.** His impatience is clear—he does not see the need for delay when the technology is already functional. But Heimerdinger remains firm, warning that putting such power into the hands of the public too soon is dangerous. He encourages them to continue refining Hextech, insisting that with time, they will find a way to safeguard it against misuse.

## Progress Day speech
E4 23:19
The scene takes place behind the stage where Jayce is preparing for his **Progress Day speech**. Viktor, sitting and coughing, serves as a visual reminder that his health has worsened over the past seven years. He is waiting for Jayce, and when he arrives, Viktor immediately questions him: **"Where were you?"**—suggesting that he expected Jayce to be there earlier.  

As Viktor stands up, he mentions that people were asking if he could do the address instead. Jayce, recognizing their partnership, insists that Viktor should join him on stage. However, Viktor **shyly declines**, saying, **"No, no. Not in front of all of them."** Jayce doesn’t push the issue and walks away, leaving Viktor standing in place.  

Before Jayce steps onto the stage, Viktor asks if he has his speech prepared. Jayce, casually sipping coffee, confirms that he does. The scene subtly reinforces the growing distance between them—Jayce is now the public face of Hextech, while Viktor remains in the background. This is further symbolized when Jayce sets his cup down in a way that **completely obscures Viktor from view**, visually placing him in the shadows.  

As Jayce steps onto the stage to applause, he begins his speech with a humble introduction, acknowledging that **no one ever expected much from him.** The camera then briefly pans to Viktor, who smiles at this remark, suggesting that he still shares in Jayce’s success on some level.  

Jayce then speaks about Piltover’s prosperity, highlighting how the **Hexgates** have changed everything. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Viktor places his hands on a lever, ready to unveil their latest invention—the **Hextech Gemstone**—expecting it to be the grand reveal.  

However, when the time comes, Jayce hesitates. He struggles with his words, leaving Viktor visibly confused as he waits for the signal. Instead of unveiling the gemstone, Jayce **changes course**, telling the audience that they will share their latest advancement **"when the time is right."** The camera cuts to Viktor, who looks **slightly surprised** by this unexpected decision.  

Jayce then continues his speech, shifting focus to a broader promise: that Hextech will bring an end to hardships for **everyone**, regardless of their status. He declares that Piltover will continue to **press forward as the City of Progress**, ending on a triumphant note as fireworks explode overhead.  

The scene highlights the shifting dynamic between Jayce and Viktor. While they are still partners, Viktor remains behind the curtain—both literally and figuratively—while Jayce steps fully into the role of Piltover’s visionary leader.

## Stolen Gemstone
E4 28:50
The scene opens with Viktor informing the Council that the **Hextech Gemstone has been stolen**, along with some of their research papers. Sheriff Marcus provides an update, stating that the situation is still developing and that no group from the **undercity** has claimed responsibility.

Heimerdinger, deeply concerned, questions how things have escalated to this point. The council members quickly shift the conversation to **the broader issue of Piltover’s relationship with the undercity**. While some councilors argue that the undercity has been left unchecked for too long, others remind them that its people are still part of Piltover, despite their lack of representation.

The discussion turns toward the **potential danger of the stolen Hextech Gemstone**. Councilor Bolbok directly asks Jayce if the trenchers could build a weapon using the crystal. Jayce, after standing up from his chair, acknowledges that **if the right person acquired it, they could use its energy** for dangerous purposes. Councilor Kiramman insists that they must take immediate action.

As Viktor moves to stand, **Jayce subtly signals for him to stay seated**—not as a deliberate act of distancing himself, but rather as a natural response to the situation. There is no visible sign that Viktor takes it personally, nor that Jayce is aware of any deeper meaning in the gesture. Jayce then takes center stage and takes full responsibility for the theft, acknowledging that **he failed to protect Hextech and that his mistake cost lives**. In a drastic move, he recommends that **all Hextech operations be suspended** until the situation is under control—including their laboratories, refinery, and even the Hexgates. The camera briefly pans to Viktor, who looks **saddened** by this decision.

The Council reacts immediately. Some, like Councilor Hoskel, are outraged at the idea, pointing out that shutting down the **Hexgates would cripple Piltover’s economy** and leave thousands unemployed. Others, like Jayce, argue that **public safety must come first**. Even Heimerdinger is surprised, asking if Jayce is truly willing to **sacrifice his life's work** for security.

With the Council deadlocked, Mel steps in and proposes **a more radical solution**. She highlights Jayce’s willingness to **sacrifice his own enterprise** for the city's well-being and argues that **only Jayce has the expertise to protect Hextech**. She then makes a bold suggestion: **elevating Jayce to a seat on the Council.**

The scene visually reinforces the shift in Jayce’s status—**as the camera pans, he is standing in the center, bathed in light, while Viktor remains seated, partially covered in shadows.** This framing subtly underscores how **Jayce is rising in power while Viktor remains sidelined.**

The Council reacts with skepticism. They point out that their **seven seats have remained unchanged for generations**, and some question whether Jayce has enough experience for such a position. However, Heimerdinger supports Mel’s proposal, stating that **Hextech security should be handled by a scientist**, and officially seconds the motion.

With that, Mel calls for a vote, setting the stage for Jayce’s rise to power.

## Jayce tightening Hexgate security
E5 08:40
The scene takes place at the Hexgate, where Jayce and Viktor are reviewing trade manifests. Jayce points out months of discrepancies, linking them to the recent smuggling incident and implying that corruption runs much deeper. Viktor, however, is visibly frustrated, dismissing the investigation as a poor use of their time.  

Jayce, now fully stepping into his role as a Councilor, insists that ensuring the Hexgates' security is his responsibility. Viktor, unconvinced, questions whether this aligns with their original mission—improving lives, especially for those in need, including the undercity. He reminds Jayce of the promises they made, his tone carrying a clear impatience.  

Jayce sighs, apologizing for not announcing their other projects during his Progress Day speech. He tries to reassure Viktor that they will get to everything soon, but Viktor immediately cuts him off, saying, "Soon? There are people who need our help now, Jayce." His tone makes it clear that he is tired of waiting and sees no reason to delay further.  

Before the argument can continue, Sheriff Marcus arrives. Jayce confronts him about the inconsistencies in the Hexgate logs, demanding that any unauthorized goods be seized. He hands Marcus a list of suspicious transactions, asserting that he is determined to root out corruption. When Marcus hesitates, suggesting Jayce should consult the other Councilors first, Jayce shuts him down, correcting him that it is already his second day as Councilor and reaffirming his authority.  

The conversation then shifts to the stolen Hextech Gemstone. Marcus reveals that their primary suspects are an undercity gang called the Firelights. He describes them as phantoms, operating through hit-and-run tactics and vanishing without a trace. Jayce demands results, pressing Marcus for a timeline on capturing them.  

During this exchange, Viktor starts coughing, his condition worsening. As Jayce and Marcus continue speaking in the background, Viktor coughs blood into his hand. His attention, however, is no longer on the conversation. His eyes become locked onto the Hexgate components in front of him, his mind seemingly elsewhere.  

A mysterious, almost ominous musical cue plays, suggesting that something about the Hexgate has caught his interest. From this moment on, he is completely disengaged from Jayce and Marcus' discussion—whether he even registers details about the Firelights is unclear.  

Noticing his silence, Jayce turns to him and asks if he’s all right. Viktor, visibly weakened, mutters that it’s just a headache before stating that he needs to get to the lab—his focus now entirely elsewhere.

## Hextech can learn?
E5 13:20
The scene takes place in the lab. Jayce is looking at himself in the mirror, while Viktor is fully focused on a **new version of the Hextech Gemstone**, which is surrounded by small metallic plates, each engraved with a rune, subtly highlighting their differing priorities.  

Jayce asks, **"You had a vision?"** as if picking up on an ongoing discussion. Viktor, deep in thought, explains that they may have been looking at Hextech the wrong way. Instead of trying to discover runes that invoke specific effects and molding them into tools, he suggests a different approach. **"If the legends are true, mages aren't bound to single functions. It's said the Arcane speaks through them."** As Viktor explains, Sky Young, an assistant, briefly hands Jayce some blueprints of the device Viktor is working on. Jayce takes a quick glance at them before responding, **"I'm still not following."**  

Viktor continues, expanding on his idea. **"They think. They adapt."** Jayce, still trying to grasp the concept, asks, **"You think Hextech can… learn?"** Viktor continues to tinker with the device when it suddenly emits a small, contained explosion. Jayce, now clearly concerned, asks, **"Are you sure this is safe?"** Viktor, without hesitation and in a somewhat nonchalant tone, simply responds, **"Of course not."**

## Viktor's Late Night
The scene begins with Viktor working on his device, deeply immersed in his research. He briefly pauses, pinching the sides of his nose between his thumb and index finger, showing a sign of mild frustration or exhaustion. His focus remains entirely on the contraption in front of him.

Sky Young enters the lab, standing at a distance behind Viktor. She observes his work for a moment before softly saying, **"It's beautiful."** Viktor, still facing the device, does not turn to acknowledge her and instead mutters, **"I can't figure out why it's not working."** His response is direct, showing that his thoughts are still consumed by the problem at hand.

Sky, trying to reassure him, responds with confidence, **"You will."** Her tone carries an admiration for his persistence. Meanwhile, Viktor glances at some papers on the table, shifting his attention to his notes.

She then asks, **"Are you headed home soon? I thought we could walk together."** Her words and delivery suggest a personal warmth, possibly even romantic interest, but Viktor does not seem to notice. Instead, his focus remains on the papers in front of him. Without looking up, he responds absentmindedly, **"I'm, uh, probably going to sleep here tonight."**

Sky expresses mild concern, **"Again? You know there's always tomorrow, right?"** But Viktor remains unwavering in his dedication. His response, **"Good night, Miss Young,"** is subtly softer in tone, though still distant. Sky offers him a small, genuine smile before leaving, seemingly accustomed to his singular focus on work.

Left alone, Viktor continues testing the device, but nothing new happens. Frustration builds, and he suddenly stands up, weakly slamming the table. Papers scatter, and his chair rolls back as he exhales sharply. His frustration quickly turns to physical distress as dizziness overtakes him. His vision blurs, tinged with a red haze from his perspective.

Overcome by weakness, Viktor collapses onto the desk, supporting himself with his arms. A fit of violent coughing follows, and **he spits blood onto the table, right in front of the device.**

As he falls to the ground, the **Hexcore** reacts for the first time. The blood on the table begins to rise, a single droplet **levitating toward the gemstone in the center of the device.** The scene lingers on this moment, marking an unexpected and possibly significant reaction.

## Viktor in the hospital
E5 31:48
The scene opens with Viktor lying unconscious in a hospital bed, his breathing deep and steady. Jayce sits beside him in a chair, his head lowered, seemingly weighed down by emotion. The atmosphere is quiet and somber.

After a moment, Viktor stirs and weakly speaks, **"Jayce?"** Jayce immediately raises his head, his expression showing both relief and sadness.

Struggling to find the right words, Jayce hesitates before finally saying, **"Viktor, the doctors, um, they said you're…"**His voice is heavy with emotion, making it clear that whatever news he has to deliver is difficult for him to say.

Viktor exhales, taking in the situation without panic. Instead of reacting with shock or denial, he calmly asks, **"How much time do I have?"** His tone suggests a level of acceptance, as if he had already come to terms with the reality of his condition.

## Young Viktor part 1
E6 00:00
The scene begins with a young Viktor near a body of water, separate from where the other children are playing. While they laugh and splash around in the distance, **Viktor is alone in another stream, testing a functioning toy boat that he built himself.** Even at his young age, he is already reliant on a cane, subtly reinforcing that he is different from the other kids—not just in intellect, but in physical ability as well. The boat is shown to be **highly complex**, containing many intricate parts that emphasize his ingenuity.

After carefully placing the boat in the water to test it, **the current pulls it downstream faster than he can keep up with.** Determined not to lose his creation, he hurries after it, but in his struggle to move quickly, **he stumbles and falls.** Still undeterred, he picks himself up and continues following the stream, eventually venturing into **a dark cave.**

As Viktor finally catches up to his boat, **he sees it in the hands of a man at a distance.** Before he can fully process the situation, **a large mutated creature suddenly props itself up beside the man.** The sight startles Viktor, and he gasps in surprise. **The creature hears his reaction and responds with a growl.**

Sensing Viktor’s fear, the man speaks in a calm tone, saying, **"Don’t be afraid."** His words break the tension, signaling that he does not see Viktor as an intruder. The moment marks **Viktor’s first encounter with the man who will later be known as "The Doctor."**

The tension eases as the man shifts his attention to Viktor, studying him with curiosity. He then asks, **"Why aren’t you playing with the others?"** His tone is not judgmental, but rather as if he already understands the answer. Viktor does not respond, but his presence alone suggests why—he is different, isolated, and drawn to things beyond simple childhood games.  

The man then introduces the creature beside him, **"This is Rio."** He explains that Rio is **a rare mutation that he has cultivated.** Viktor, still cautious but intrigued, watches as the man plucks a **purple flower** from nearby and extends it toward him. **"Here,"** he says, gesturing for Viktor to feed Rio.  

After a brief hesitation, Viktor follows the instruction. As he reaches out, **Rio extends an abnormally long tongue, stretching across Viktor’s entire arm to take the flower.** The bizarre sight momentarily catches Viktor off guard, but as Rio eats, **he giggles, his initial fear replaced by fascination.**  

The man’s expression remains unreadable as he watches the interaction. Then, his tone shifts slightly, turning somber. **"She's dying."** Viktor’s smile fades as he looks at the creature again, now seeing it in a different light.

The man continues, explaining, **"I'm attempting to prevent that. The mutation must survive."** There is a weight in his words, as if he is speaking about something far greater than just this single creature.  

Without hesitation, Viktor asks, **"Can I help?"** His voice carries no fear or doubt—only genuine interest.  

The man tilts his head slightly, as if surprised by the question. **"You want to assist me?"** Viktor gives a small shrug, neither eager nor hesitant, but simply willing.  

The man nods in approval and responds, **"Very well. We can be loners together."**  

The scene ends with this statement, marking the beginning of a connection between Viktor and the man who will later play a significant role in shaping his views on science, progress, and survival.

## Viktor and Heimer
E6 03:35
The scene begins with Viktor sitting on the **ledge of a clock tower**, seemingly lost in thought. The tower, presumably part of the **academy**, serves as a secluded place for reflection.

Heimerdinger walks into the frame and stands next to Viktor, looking out over the city. With a warm but nostalgic tone, he says, **"Good to see some things haven't changed."** He then reminisces about the past, recalling how he once stumbled upon **an aspiring young scholar from the undercity, ruminating in his steel oasis.** His words suggest that Viktor has always been drawn to isolation and deep contemplation, even from a young age.

Shifting the mood, Heimerdinger gently acknowledges the reality of Viktor’s condition. **"I heard your prognosis. I'm terribly sorry, my boy."** His tone carries genuine sadness, recognizing the weight of what Viktor is facing.

Rather than reacting emotionally, Viktor instead asks, **"Do you contemplate death, Professor?"** His question is direct, philosophical, and almost detached, showing that his thoughts are not on fear or grief, but rather on **the impermanence of life itself.**

Heimerdinger responds softly, **"Only that of friends."** His long lifespan makes his perspective different—he has seen many come and go, and rather than fearing his own death, he mourns the loss of those he outlives.

Viktor, exhaling, reflects on Heimerdinger’s place in history. **"I suppose your legacy has been well-secured. As one of Piltover's founders, what haven't you to show for your remarkable life?"** His words suggest admiration but also a contrast—while Heimerdinger’s name will be remembered for centuries, Viktor feels as if his own impact will be fleeting.

Heimerdinger, perhaps sensing Viktor’s internal struggle, tries to reassure him. **"You should be proud of what you've accomplished, Viktor."** However, Viktor does not share this sentiment. His response, **"Figments. My contributions will be short-lived, even in your memory,"** reveals his belief that his work will fade into obscurity, as if everything he has done will be meaningless once he is gone.

Heimerdinger, taking a moment to reflect, offers a somber truth: **"I have seen many students. It's a sad truth that those who shine brightest often burn fastest."** His words acknowledge Viktor’s brilliance but also imply that extraordinary minds often face the burden of an accelerated and intense existence.

The scene ends on this melancholic note, leaving Viktor’s thoughts on mortality and legacy unresolved, yet deeply felt.

## Viktor and hexcore
E6 07:48
The scene opens with Viktor standing in the lab, **staring soullessly at the Hexcore.** The device, which once emitted a **blue glow**, now radiates **a deep purple light**, marking a significant change. His expression is distant, as if he is completely absorbed by the sight before him.

Slowly, Viktor **stands up and approaches the device**, his movements deliberate but almost entranced. As he gets closer, he begins **recalling the moment he coughed blood and collapsed,** replaying the experience in his mind. Something about that event—and the Hexcore’s reaction to it—has left a lasting impression.

Without hesitation, **he extends his arm and touches the Hexcore.** The device, which is always **suspended in the air and rotating slowly,** begins to **spin faster upon contact.**

As this happens, Viktor’s body **visibly reacts** to the connection. His eyes roll back, his face contorting in a way that suggests an intense, overwhelming sensation—almost like a rush of euphoria or transcendence.

## Viktor shows Jayce
E6 15:05
The scene takes place in the lab, where Viktor and Jayce are conducting an experiment on the **Hexcore.** Viktor, eager to demonstrate his discovery, instructs Jayce to **watch.**

Above the Hexcore, **a plant is suspended.** As the device activates, **the plant begins to grow at an exponential rate, rapidly expanding into a large and vibrant form.**

Viktor, watching intently, explains, **"It responds to organic matter."** The energy from the Hexcore is influencing **living tissue**, something entirely new.

Jayce, awestruck, mutters, **"Incredible."**

Viktor continues, his excitement building as he realizes the implications. **"This is unlike anything we've ever seen, Jayce. It, it, it could be the key to augmenting physiology, extending life…"** His words suggest that the Hexcore’s potential goes far beyond theoretical applications—it could **redefine human limits.**

Jayce, understanding the deeper meaning behind Viktor’s words, **softly adds, "Curing you."** His voice carries **hope,** as if this might be the answer to saving Viktor’s life.

However, just as quickly as the plant flourishes, **it begins to wither.** The vibrant green fades into a **dead, brown husk**, its life drained in an instant.

Viktor, disheartened but still analytical, states, **"It's happened to everyone. I can't determine why. They're… rejecting the transmutation."** The solemn tone suggests that this is not an isolated failure—everything he has tried so far has met the same fate.

A heavy silence lingers between them before Viktor sighs, his voice carrying a rare vulnerability. **"There may not be time. We're in uncharted waters here and… I can feel my body… eroding."** His words make the situation clear—he is running out of time.

Jayce, unwilling to accept defeat, immediately takes action. **"I'll have Sky bring Heimerdinger. He might know something that could help."** He holds onto the belief that **there is still a way forward.**

Turning back to Viktor, Jayce **grabs a piece of chalk**, ready to work. **"In the meantime, we'll do what we do best."** Despite the uncertainty, he refuses to stop trying.

## Viktor and Jayce show Heimerdinger
The scene begins with **Heimerdinger entering the lab**, immediately **noticing the Hexcore** with a look of slight **horror**. **"What is that?"** he asks, his voice carrying an edge of unease.

Viktor, just as **enthusiastic as Jayce**, responds immediately. **"I'm calling it the Hexcore. It's an adaptive rune matrix. Hextech that evolves."** His excitement suggests that he truly believes in the revolutionary potential of what they have created.

Jayce, equally eager, **stammers slightly before calling it groundbreaking.** He further explains, **"What's most exciting is that it reacts to biological matter. There are stories of healing magic. Our samples thus far have perished…"**

However, Heimerdinger is no longer listening. His attention is fully locked onto the **Hexcore itself,** his expression darkening. In a subtle yet powerful moment, **the viewers see a representation of a mage destroying a nation**—a visual cue to Heimerdinger’s past and his belief that this kind of magic is **dangerous beyond comprehension.**

With deep urgency, he states, **"You must destroy it."**

Jayce, taken aback, reacts immediately. **"What?"**

Heimerdinger turns to them, pleading, **"Please, if ever you've put faith in my guidance, hear me now. I've seen nations destroyed by a single seed and it looked… exactly like this."** His words make it clear—this is not theoretical fear, but something he has **witnessed before.**

Jayce, however, sees the **Hexcore** as something entirely different. **"Professor, this could save Viktor's life."** His concern is **personal**, not historical. To him, the risk is **worth taking.**

Heimerdinger then turns to Viktor, now studying him closely. **"Viktor, something's different. You've changed. What did you do?"**

Viktor’s response is **uncharacteristically strange.** His **smile is unnatural**, and his tone **feels off**, making it unclear whether he is amused, deflecting, or genuinely confused. **"What do you mean, Professor?"** This kind of reaction does not happen again in the show, making it difficult to interpret.

Heimerdinger, now fully convinced of the **Hexcore’s danger**, raises his voice: **"It's that thing. It must be destroyed!"**

Jayce, unwilling to accept this, **steps forward firmly.** **"No. I won't let you."** His voice is resolute, making it clear that this creation is **too important to abandon.**

Heimerdinger’s **Poro companion barks,** adding to the tension.

Heimerdinger, now at a crossroads, warns, **"Jayce, this is a violation of the Ethos. I will have it destroyed one way or another."**

Jayce, no longer simply a scientist but now a **Councilor**, asserts his authority. **"That's your opinion. We'll see if the Council agrees."** His words suggest that he is willing to take **a political approach to protect the Hexcore,** setting up a clear divide between him and Heimerdinger.

The room falls into a tense silence. Heimerdinger, seeing no immediate way forward, leaves. His Poro, after a final bark, follows him.

Viktor, now more pensive, mutters, **"I might know someone else who could help."** His tone suggests **uncertainty**—as if seeking this person’s help is **not an easy decision.** He does not elaborate, and Jayce does not press him on it.

Instead, Jayce, clearly preoccupied with other matters, responds, **"You do what you have to. I need to get ready."**

Viktor, puzzled, asks, **"For what?"**

The scene **ends on this question,** leaving Viktor uncertain about what exactly Jayce is preparing for, while the tension between progress and caution continues to grow.

## Young Viktor part 2
	
The scene takes us back to Viktor’s childhood. This time, he is seen **carrying a box full of the same purple flowers** he previously fed to Rio. As he enters the cave, he ventures **deeper than before**, stepping into the **Doctor’s quarters** for the first time.  

Upon entering, Viktor’s eyes immediately fall to **Rio, now lying on the ground, connected to several tubes.** A strange liquid—what we now recognize as **Shimmer**—is being pumped into the creature’s body. The sight visibly distresses Viktor, who **gasps and rushes toward Rio, falling to his knees beside him.**  

Rio lets out **pained squeals and deep, guttural growls**, struggling under the effects of the mutation.  

Viktor, still catching his breath, looks up at the Doctor and asks, **"You did this?"** His voice carries **a mix of confusion and betrayal**, as if the trust he once had in this man is now in question.  

The Doctor, however, remains calm. **"I thought you understood. The mutation must survive."** His tone is unwavering, as if the experiment was the **only logical course of action.**  

As Rio continues to writhe and let out painful sounds, **Viktor suddenly turns and runs away.** He does not stay to argue—he simply **flees the scene, overwhelmed.**  

The camera lingers on the Doctor, who remains by Rio’s side, **gently petting the creature despite its suffering.** His presence is **unshaken**, and the **ominous music** suggests that this is only the beginning of something far greater.  

The scene then transitions **to the same cave in the present day.** The setup has **evolved**, the Doctor’s experiments now far more advanced. **Rio is no longer lying on the ground but floating in a vertical water chamber, suspended in liquid.** The Doctor stands before the tank, observing his work in silence.  

Suddenly, **Viktor enters the scene.** His expression is no longer that of the frightened child who once ran away. Instead, he walks forward with purpose and simply states:  

**"I understand now."**  

The Doctor, hearing his voice, slowly turns to face him.

## Viktor and Singed
E7 05:10
The scene takes place in **Singed’s laboratory**, deep within the cave. Singed is seen **studying plant patterns under a microscope**, his fascination evident as he quietly observes.

"Hmm. Fascinating," he mutters before shifting his attention to Viktor. **"I would very much like to see the device. This, uh, Hexcore."** His interest is clear—he is eager to examine Viktor’s work firsthand.

Viktor, however, **hesitates**. **"That may be difficult to arrange."** His tone suggests that bringing Singed directly into his research is **not an easy decision**. **He then coughs, a reminder of his deteriorating health, before continuing.** **"I've tried every combination of runes, but… it's always the same. The subject withers and rots."** Frustration lingers in his voice, as if no matter how much progress he makes, the same failure repeats itself.

Singed, rather than addressing the runes or calculations, **suggests a different possibility.** **"Perhaps the error resides not with your calculations but… with your subjects."** He explains that **nature itself is resistant to change**, but unlike nature, humans have the ability to **change themselves.** As he speaks, he holds up **a vial of Shimmer**, letting Viktor take in its significance.

Viktor eyes the vial before asking, **"And this is… Shimmer?"**

Singed nods, clarifying, **"A variant. It should provide everything one needs to survive a violent transition."** His wording is deliberate—he does not present it as a cure, but as a means to endure what would otherwise be fatal.

Viktor, still clinging to his original goal, asks, **"Will it work on plants?"**

Singed does not answer the question directly. Instead, he looks at Viktor knowingly and says, **"You aren't here about the plants, are you?"** His voice carries an air of certainty. **"I know the look of a doomed man."**

Singed then **issues a warning, not a persuasion.** **"I must warn you. If you take this path, they will despise you."** He makes it clear that **this choice comes with consequences.** He follows up with a personal confession: **"Love and legacy are the sacrifices we make for progress. It’s why I parted ways with Heimerdinger."** The statement is layered, revealing that Singed himself was once faced with a choice between personal relationships and scientific advancement—and he chose progress, regardless of the cost.

Importantly, Singed does not **force, manipulate, or deceive Viktor** into taking the Shimmer. **He simply offers an option.**

Viktor, after a moment of contemplation, responds with quiet certainty, **"Jayce will understand."**

Singed, neither confirming nor denying, simply replies, **"Perhaps."** His tone carries **a quiet skepticism**, as if he knows that understanding and acceptance are not always the same.

## Undercity Blockade
E7 13:00
The scene takes place **at the bridge leading to the undercity**, where **a blockade is in full effect.** Enforcers are actively restraining and containing **undercity residents**, pushing them back as **shouts and protests** fill the air. The atmosphere is tense, with **authorities standing firm and civilians growing increasingly desperate.**  

Amid the chaos, **Viktor is seated on the side, safely away from the immediate confrontation.** He watches the scene unfold with a **silent but heavy gaze.** As the enforcers bark orders and the undercity citizens plead to be let through, **Viktor coughs into a cloth he pulls from his pocket.** When he lowers it, we see **that it is already stained with blood.** Without a word, he folds it and tucks it back away, as if accepting the grim reality of his condition.  

His expression shifts as he **shakes his head disapprovingly** at the blockade, clearly dissatisfied with how **his own people are being treated.** His gaze then drifts downward, settling on **his cane.** He stares at it for a moment, lost in thought—**perhaps reminiscing on how much more he could do if he weren’t crippled.**  

At this moment, **Jayce arrives at the blockade, speaking with Sheriff Marcus.** After briefly acknowledging the situation, he thanks him, saying, **"Thank you for alerting me, Sheriff."** Without hesitation, he **walks over to Viktor**, his frustration already evident.  

**"Jayce, what is this?"** Viktor asks, confused by what he is witnessing. His voice carries concern, but there is also **a hint of disappointment** as he takes in the scene.  

Jayce, speaking quietly but with clear anger, retorts, **"Do you have any idea how this looks? I order a blockade and my own partner violates it?"** His tone is controlled, but the frustration is unmistakable—**he sees Viktor’s actions as undermining his authority.**  

Viktor, visibly displeased, questions him further. **"You ordered this? Why?"** His expression shifts to **one of slight disgust or disapproval**, as if the realization of Jayce’s direct involvement makes the situation worse.  

Jayce, still trying to justify himself, answers, **"There are people down there who seem hell-bent on destroying us. What were you doing?"** His words reveal a growing **fear of the undercity**, seeing it as a threat rather than part of the city he once wanted to help.  

Viktor, maintaining his composure, explains, **"I was consulting a friend about our quandary. I told you, I knew someone."** His tone is calm, but he **does not elaborate on who this friend is.**  

Jayce immediately seizes on this missing information. **"Well, you didn't say they were from the undercity."** His reaction makes it clear that, to him, **this detail changes everything.**  

Viktor, unimpressed, fires back with a simple question. **"What difference does that make?"** His voice remains level, but the challenge is direct—**he is forcing Jayce to confront his own prejudice.**  

Jayce, as if realizing his own bias mid-sentence, starts to respond but **stumbles over his words.** **"What diff… They're dangerous."** His hesitation betrays the fact that this is **more of an ingrained belief than a reasoned conclusion.**  

At this, **Viktor begins to stand, using his cane for support, and pointedly states, "I'm from the undercity."** His words land heavily, **turning Jayce’s logic back on him.** If the undercity itself is inherently dangerous, then what does that make Viktor?  

Jayce, visibly recognizing his mistake, does not argue. Instead, he **concedes with a simple, "You're right."** He extends a hand to help Viktor up, but **Viktor lightly swats it away with the outside of his own, rejecting the offer.**  

Jayce, now more subdued, **softens his tone.** **"I'm sorry. I've had a lot on my plate."** He is no longer defensive—**this is a genuine apology.** Wanting to move forward, he shifts the conversation back to Viktor’s meeting. **"Was your friend able to help?"**  

Viktor, still slightly disheartened, responds, **"No. No, he said, 'Nature was resistant to this sort of tampering.'"** His answer is quiet, almost resigned, but there is something else beneath it—**he does not mention the Shimmer.** Previously, when speaking with Singed, he had confidently stated that **"Jayce will understand"** his decision. But now, after seeing Jayce’s reaction to the undercity, **he no longer seems certain.** Given Jayce’s growing distrust of anything tied to Zaun, Viktor seems to **doubt that Jayce would be able to accept the path he is considering.** Instead of sharing what truly happened, he chooses to keep it to himself.  

Jayce, now back in his problem-solving mindset, nods and says, **"All right, we'll keep at it."** His words signal that, despite the tension between them, their **shared goal remains unchanged.**

## Bomb disarming scene
E7 23:00
The scene takes place in **the lab**, where **Viktor, Jayce, and Mel** are gathered around a **bomb-like device**. **Viktor is at the center, carefully inspecting it.**  

As he examines the craftsmanship, he mutters, **"Um, the form is crude, but… the engineering is… inspired."** His words, though simple, **carry a hint of reluctant admiration**—whoever built this may lack refinement, but their ingenuity is undeniable.  

Mel, watching closely, asks, **"You think they could crack Hextech?"**  

Viktor, while still focused on the device, responds, **"Mm. It's a leap."** He then starts **taking it apart**, wanting to understand it further.  

Mel continues, escalating the concern. **"It's been suggested that they may have found a way to utilize the Gemstone."** She lets this sink in before adding, **"If we are to assume the worst, that would mean they've turned it into a weapon."**  

Jayce, skeptical, asks, **"Well, do we know this for certain?"**  

Mel, unfazed by his hesitation, responds, **"We can't afford to wait to find out."**  

At this, **Viktor stops what he is doing and turns toward her.** He asks, **"Wait. What are you suggesting?"** His tone reveals that **he already has an idea of where this is heading, and he does not like it.** His later reactions show that he may not have grasped **the exact details** yet, but he **knows it is something troubling.**  

Mel, without hesitation, states, **"We should prepare our own countermeasures."**  

Jayce, his concern now evident, asks, **"You want us to build weapons?"**  

Viktor immediately **cuts in, adamantly rejecting the idea.** **"Absolutely not. That is not why we invented Hextech."** His voice is firm, his conviction unwavering.  

Jayce, agreeing with Viktor, adds, **"We would shatter any attempt at peace. Heimerdinger would never go for this."**  

Mel, however, **counters with a pointed remark.** **"Heimerdinger's inaction is what brought us here. You said so yourself."** As she says this, **Viktor looks slightly taken aback.** His reaction suggests that he is **either unaware that Heimerdinger has been removed from the Council or that he did not fully grasp Jayce’s shift in stance toward Heimerdinger’s methods.**  

Mel, pressing further, tells Jayce, **"The peace is already broken, Jayce. I'm only asking you to prepare to defend your people."** As she says this, **Viktor’s face hardens slightly.** His expression conveys **resentment**, not just toward the idea of weapons but **toward the way Jayce and Mel speak about the undercity—as if it is something to be managed from a distance rather than a part of Piltover.**  

Mel then offers a final justification. **"If we're lucky, we'll never need to use it."** She leaves the decision with them and, without another word, **exits the room.**  

Viktor **scoffs in frustration.** Jayce, clearly conflicted, sighs and **steps away from the table.**  

After a beat, Viktor speaks, his frustration evident. **"Ridiculous. You cannot be considering this."**  

Jayce, struggling with his thoughts, challenges him. **"What if she's right? Are we just gonna stand by while they attack us?"** He turns toward Viktor as he says this, his voice carrying the weight of his internal conflict.  

Viktor, remaining firm, turns halfway toward him and states, **"We're scientists,"** Then, turning fully to face Jayce, he adds, **"not soldiers."**  

Jayce, desperate to justify his reasoning, argues, **"We have the knowledge to defend ourselves."**  

Viktor, still examining the bomb, **replies in the same tone as before, his frustration evident.** However, this time, he **stammers slightly as he speaks**, saying, **"We agreed Hextech was to improve lives, not- not to take them."** His voice wavers just enough to reveal **his deep disappointment,** as if the mere thought of weaponizing their work is painful to even say aloud.
	
Jayce, still reluctant but unwilling to let go of the idea, says, **"We may not have a choice."**  

At that moment, **Viktor removes a part of the bomb, and it suddenly starts beeping.**  

Both men **gasp** slightly as the ticking begins to accelerate.  

Viktor quickly **slides a small knife under a wire, preparing to cut it.** He **pauses**, staring at it for a long moment. His expression is difficult to read—it is as if he is **contemplating something deeply** as the ticking grows louder.  

Then, just before it can detonate, **he cuts the wire.**  

The bomb **powers down with a hiss, silencing the tension.**  

Viktor exhales, then, without looking up, mutters, **"There is always a choice."** His words directly counter Jayce’s argument, **reinforcing his belief that they do not have to resort to violence.**  

Jayce, still uncertain, simply responds, **"I need to think."** Without waiting for a response, **he turns and leaves the lab.**  

Viktor remains behind, standing over the now-defused bomb, as if the weight of the discussion still lingers.

## Viktor takes shimmer
E7 26:50
The scene takes place in the **lab**, where **Viktor sits alone in front of the Hexcore.** The room is quiet, heavy with the weight of what he is about to do.  

With steady but tense movements, **he unscrews the handle of his cane, revealing the hidden vial of Shimmer.** The fact that he concealed it **suggests he always knew this moment would come, even if he wasn’t ready to face it until now.**  

Viktor then **rolls up his pant leg, revealing engravings of runes that have been cut into his own skin.** The markings match those found on the Hexcore, suggesting that **they are necessary—likely to channel energy in some way.** This detail implies that Viktor **has prepared for this step carefully,** following a process rather than acting impulsively.

He then **loads a device—some kind of injection pistol—with the vial of Shimmer.** His **hands tremble** as he aims it at his malformed leg, his hesitation clear. But he does not take much time to reconsider—**he pulls the trigger.**  

The pain is immediate. **Viktor screams as his body violently reacts to the substance.** **Purple veins begin to spread across his skin, pulsing unnaturally, and his eyes briefly turn a glowing purple.** The transformation is intense but short-lived.  

Still breathing heavily, he **grabs a small knife and cuts across his right palm.** His **expression is full of nervous anticipation,** as if he is fully aware that this next step could either be his salvation or his undoing.  

Extending his **bleeding hand toward the Hexcore,** he watches as **it begins to drain his blood.** At the same time, **the runes on his leg begin to glow, reacting to the process.**  

Pain overtakes him. **His body is pulled closer, his hand becoming stuck to the Hexcore.** His **eyes roll back as the energy surges through him,** the scene ending with him caught between agony and transformation.

## Run, run, run
E8 24:37
The scene takes place **at a dock, with large boats visible in the distance.** The atmosphere is quiet, the open space emphasizing the significance of the moment.  

Viktor stands **completely upright**—for the first time since **episode 2, seven years ago.** For a brief moment, he simply **exists in this newfound state,** taking in the reality of what has happened.  

Then, in a defining gesture, **he lets go of his cane.** The sound of it **clattering to the ground** is subtle but powerful—a symbol of everything he has struggled with, now seemingly left behind. As the cane falls, **the camera focuses on his right leg, which is now purple and somewhat metallic.** The transformation is not just internal; it is **physical, undeniable.**  

Viktor exhales deeply, then **begins to run.** At first, his movements are **uncertain, almost experimental,** but as he realizes that he is able to do it, **he picks up speed.** His body moves freely, unrestricted in a way it never has before.  

Then, a **raw, heavy scream escapes from him.** It is **not from pain or exhaustion**—rather, it feels like a release of **pure, overwhelming emotion.** This is Viktor’s **first time ever running,** a moment he likely never thought he would experience.  

The scene captures the **weight of years of limitations finally being lifted.** It is a moment of triumph, of **joy mixed with disbelief,** as Viktor pushes himself forward with nothing holding him back.

## Viktor, Hexcore and Sky
E8 
The scene takes place **in the lab, in front of the Hexcore.** This time, the **Hexcore has undergone further transformation**—its glow is now **a deep purple**, and its structure has taken on **a more organic appearance**, as if it is evolving into something beyond pure technology.  

Viktor, **wearing only his underwear**, stands before it, **preparing to push his transformation further.** He holds a **vial of Shimmer**, attempting to inject it into his **left bicep.** His hands **tremble slightly—he is nervous.** But as he presses the injector, he realizes **the vial is empty.**  

Rather than stopping, **he makes a decision.** If he cannot rely on Shimmer, **he will proceed without it.**  

Determined, **he grabs a small knife and begins engraving runic symbols all over his body.** The careful placement suggests that he is **attempting a full-body transformation**, expanding what he has already done to his leg.  

Once the markings are complete, **he places his right hand onto the Hexcore.**  

Immediately, **a force begins to surge around him.** The air **pulsates with energy, creating a wind-like effect** that lifts loose papers and **sends them flying around the room.** The lab is **filled with the growing power of the Hexcore.**  

At that moment, **Sky Young enters the lab.** Her eyes widen in **shock and fear** as she takes in the sight of Viktor—**his altered body, the violent energy of the Hexcore, the instability of the entire scene.** Without hesitation, **she rushes forward, wrapping her arms around his waist, trying to pull him away.**  

But the **Hexcore is pulling in the opposite direction.**  

Viktor, caught between **Sky pulling him back and the Hexcore pulling him forward,** looks down at her **with growing concern.** He sees **her desperation, her fear for him.**  

Then, something **horrible happens.**  

Sky **begins to wither before his eyes.** Her skin **turns gray, then to ash,** her body **disintegrating as she struggles to hold onto him.** Her form **crumbles into nothingness,** as if the **Hexcore drained the life from her completely.**  

Viktor **watches in horror, unable to stop it.**  

The **Hexcore erupts in a bright light**, engulfing the room.  

When the light fades, **Viktor is lying on the ground, dazed and shaken.** His **right leg is still purple and metallic, but now his right hand—** the one that had touched the Hexcore—**has transformed as well.**  

He **slowly lifts his head, scanning the room.** Then, his eyes land on something:  

**Ash.**  

And **Sky’s glasses, lying on the floor.**  

Realization sets in. His breathing quickens. **"Sky? Sky?"** His voice cracks. **"No."**  

He **crawls toward the ashes, his voice growing more frantic.**  

**"No! That… that can't… that can't…"**  

The lab is now silent. The **Hexcore, still floating in its place, has changed once again.** It **looks even more biological than before—less mechanical, yet still recognizable.** Its dimensions remain the same, but its **form is evolving into something unexplainable.**  

Viktor, still kneeling on the ground, is left **alone with the weight of what he has done.**

## Viktor grieving
E9 04:50
The scene opens in the **lab**, where **Viktor is still on the ground, clutching Sky’s glasses.** His **body trembles as he sobs, overcome with grief.**

His eyes fall on **Sky’s notes, which she had brought with her when she came to see him.** With shaking hands, he begins reading them, his breath still uneven from crying.

Her words play in his mind as if she is speaking directly to him:

**"Viktor… I know this will probably never see the light of day, but watching how you work so tirelessly to make the world a better place…"**

Her voice is soft, hopeful, carrying the admiration she always held for him.

**"Well, I couldn't forgive myself if I didn't try."**

As the words sink in, **Viktor curls into a fetal position, still holding onto her glasses.** He sobs quietly, overwhelmed by guilt and loss.

The final words from her notes reach him:

**"Everyone's gotta do their part, right?"**

The **lab remains eerily silent, save for Viktor’s uneven breathing.**

Then, a faint **rumbling sound breaks the stillness.**

**Viktor slowly lifts his head, his gaze shifting toward the Hexcore.** The sight of it fills him with something different this time—not curiosity, not wonder, but **a quiet, simmering anger.**

Determined, he **wobbly stands up, his body unsteady but still able to move without his cane.** His steps are slow, more difficult than before, but he forces himself forward until he is **standing directly in front of the Hexcore.**

Then, **he grabs a chair.**

With both hands, he **lifts it over his head, ready to strike the Hexcore.** His arms tremble under the weight—not just of the chair, but of **everything that has happened.**

For a brief moment, he hesitates. His grip tightens, his eyes locked onto the device that has taken so much from him.

But he does not bring it down.

Instead, **his breathing steadies, and he lowers the chair.**

**"Okay,"** he mutters under his breath.

He turns around, **deciding to walk away.**

But just as he does, the **Hexcore suddenly reacts.**

Without warning, **a telepathic energy surge lashes out, striking Viktor’s leg and head.**

**He cries out in pain, collapsing to the ground.** Gritting his teeth, he **lifts his head, looking at the Hexcore.** His expression is no longer one of anger—it is **a mix of confusion, fear, and something else entirely.**

## In the pursuit of great
The scene takes place **at the ledge of the clocktower**, the same spot where Viktor once spoke with Heimerdinger. The height, the open sky, the silence—it all **creates an isolated, solemn atmosphere.**  

Viktor stands **with his cane, his right hand covered by a glove, concealing his transformation.** He holds a **cylinder** in his hands, his grip firm but hesitant.  

**"I'm sorry. I don't know where you'd have preferred,"** he says softly. His voice is **heavy with guilt and sorrow.**  

After a beat, he repeats, **"I'm sorry."**  

Then, **he opens the cylinder and releases Sky’s ashes.** The gray dust **scatters in the wind, falling below.** He lets the **cylinder drop along with them,** letting go of something more than just the physical remains—**a final goodbye, though one filled with regret.**  

He then kneels to **pick up Sky’s glasses and her book of notes,** the last tangible pieces of her that remain.  

He coughs, his illness still a reminder that his time is limited.  

Viktor turns to leave, but something **pulls him back.**  

He **steps forward again, this time approaching the ledge, looking down over it.** There is **a long pause** before he slowly **pushes his left leg over the edge.** His movements are deliberate, his posture **eerily calm.** He is **ready to go through with it.**  

Then, suddenly—  

**"Am I interrupting?"**  

Jayce’s voice **cuts through the silence.**  

As Viktor turns toward him, **Jayce watches him carefully, his expression shifting.** There is **a moment of recognition in his eyes—an unspoken acknowledgment that this has happened before.** Only last time, **the roles were reversed.**

Viktor had once **interrupted Jayce on the verge of a similar decision, pulling him away from despair and into purpose.** Now, standing before him, **Jayce silently understands that it is his turn to do the same.**

For a moment, neither of them speak.  

Then, Jayce **breaks the silence with a memory.**  

**"Remember the Distinguished Innovators competition?"**  

Viktor, still standing at the ledge, **does not hesitate in his response.** **"I remember you notching gears in the carriage over."**  

Jayce lets out a small scoff. **"They started cranking the engine and the whole thing was rattling. I thought a loose cog was gonna take someone's eye out."**  

Viktor, despite everything, allows himself to remember too. **"At least, you didn't throw up."**  

Jayce exhales, shaking his head. **"Everything made sense then."** His voice is **filled with nostalgia, but also longing—** a desire to go back to a time before everything became so complicated.  

Then, Viktor’s tone **turns serious again.**  

**"You have to destroy it."**  

Jayce’s eyes drift down to his **Hextech hammer,** but Viktor **clarifies.**  

**"The Hexcore."**  

Jayce **looks up at him, momentarily stunned.**  

**"I… I can't do it."** Jayce’s voice falters, as if admitting this is painful.  

Viktor, without hesitation, **pleads.** **"You have to. Please."** His voice is **weaker than before, but the urgency is stronger.**  

Jayce, shaken, sighs. **"What about your disease? Without the Hexcore—"**  

Before he can finish, **Viktor is overtaken by a violent cough.** He barely has the strength to speak but still manages to choke out, **"Promise me."**  

Jayce watches him, sees the desperation in his eyes. He **softens.**  

**"Okay. Okay. I promise."**  

There is a beat of silence. The weight of everything hangs between them.  

Then, Jayce speaks again. **"We lost ourselves. Lost our dream."**  

Viktor, staring at the horizon, responds with a truth neither of them can deny.  

**"In the pursuit of great, we failed to do good."**  

Finally, he adds, **"We have to make it right."**  

The **disappointment in both of them is palpable.** They are both burdened **by their own mistakes, their own internal battles.** Jayce, perhaps, is not fully aware of Viktor’s guilt, and **Viktor is not fully aware of Jayce’s.**  

But in this moment, **they share something unspoken—the understanding that they have strayed too far, and the quiet hope that it is not too late to fix it.**

## Brokering Peace
E9 23:00
The scene takes place **in the Council chamber at sunset.** The atmosphere is tense, with **Jayce standing from his seat**, while **Viktor sits beside him in silence.** Unlike past meetings where **Jayce sought approval or negotiation,** this time, his posture and tone **carry a sense of finality.**  

He begins, his voice steady but resolute.  

**"Councilors…"**  

**"My recent unsanctioned activities in the underground have shown me two things."**  

He pauses, letting his words sink in before continuing.  

**"I'm not fit to govern the people who live there. And neither are you."**  

His statement is bold, **a direct challenge to the Council’s authority over the undercity.** The weight of his words fills the room.  

**"Our opportunity to demonstrate our compassion, our dedication, our solidarity has passed."**  

His voice carries a tone of regret, **acknowledging that their chance to do the right thing is long gone.**  

**"They're right not to trust us."**  

Councilor Kiraman, clearly unsettled, **warns him.** **"You're walking a fine line, Jayce."**  

But **Jayce does not hesitate.** Any concern for political standing is gone.  

**"With respect, I don't give a shit what any of you think of me anymore."**  

His bluntness **stuns the room into silence.** Then, after a brief pause, he turns to **Mel**, his expression softer.  

**"Except you."**  

He looks at her with **sincerity,** his voice quieter but still firm.  

**"You were right. You were always right."**  

Whatever **unspoken conflict or hesitation he once had toward her guidance,** this moment **acknowledges that he now sees things as she did.**  

But Jayce is not here just to resign—he is here to **propose something unprecedented.**  

Turning back to the Council, he states, **"My days here are numbered, but I've come with Viktor, my partner and a Zaunite, with one final proposal."**  

For the first time, **Viktor speaks.** His voice is calm but firm.  

**"Jayce has brokered a peace with Silco. In exchange for the undercity's independence."**  

The words hit the room like a shockwave.  

Councilor Kiraman immediately reacts in **outrage.** **"What? Nonsense! We have procedures—"**  

Before she can finish, **the Council erupts.**  

All the councilors **stand up at once, their voices overlapping in a storm of protests.** **Shouting fills the chamber, but their words are muffled and indistinct,** drowning in the sheer **chaos of their reaction.**  

As the councilors **continue shouting in outrage**, the room is filled with disorder, voices clashing in protest. Then, **cutting through the noise, Mel speaks.**

**"I support Councilor Talis' proposal for peace."**

Her words **immediately shift the tone in the room.** One by one, the **other councilors begin to quiet down.** Slowly, **hands are raised in support.**

Jayce and Viktor exchange **a brief glance, both visibly relieved.** This is **what they had fought for—a path to peace, a chance to fix what had been broken.**

But just as the tension begins to settle—

**A sudden explosion crashes through the window.**

The force of it **shakes the chamber violently**, glass **shatters**, and everything turns **chaotic in an instant.**

The **season ends here**, leaving the fate of the council—**and the consequences of this moment—uncertain.**
